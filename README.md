## 🧠 Motivation

As someone who loves creativity and visual expression, I wanted to build a space where artists could connect, similar to how developers use GitHub or designers use Dribbble. Artfolia blends my interests in software engineering and user-centered design into a meaningful, community-driven project. I was inspired by the platform, DeviantART, and wanted to recreate something similar, while also potentially adding and enhancing features of it as someone who used to participate in this space and community as an artist myself.
